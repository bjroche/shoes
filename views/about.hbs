<h2 class="gentxt">Our heritage</h2>

<p class="gentxt">
At La Bella Scarpa, the Laurent family has been making traditional shoes for as long as anyone can remember.

We are a family business, started by our great-grandfather Pierre. Pierre had a passion for quality, stylish and contemporary footwear. He believed that if you created a great product then customers would come and stay with you. Over the last 100 years we have followed in his footsteps and our values are the same today!
</p>

<h2 class="gentxt">How do I order?</h2>
<p class="gentxt">
You can order your shoes from this website, alternatively you can phone or e-mail us (details below).
We only sell through selected retailers who are all specially and routinely trained by us to measure and ensure our shoes fit you perfectly. Our shoes are handmade, it takes us 3 months to make your shoes from when the order is received at our workshop. You will be mailed periodically with updates as your shoes progress through the process. 

You can buy shoes off the shelf. We make shoes from an D through to G fitting for our stockists.

<h2 class="gentxt">How to care for my shoes?</h2>
<p class="gentxt">
First, we recommend that you always use a cedarwood shoe tree! You should always use a shor horn to put on and take off your shoes.

Always allow your shoes to dry naturally, never in front of a heat source (fire, radiator etc).

Clean, polish and nurture your shoes regularily. We supply polishes, leather creams and brushes specifically for our shoes.

If you take care of your shoes, they should last you a life time.
</p>

<h2 class="gentxt">How do I get my shoes repaired?</h2>
<p class="gentxt">
We made your shoes and we are here to repair them. We make quality shoes which if your take care of them, they should last you a lifetime. We offer a full and complete refurbishment service. If you send us your shoes, we will de-construct them and re-build them as new on the same last as they were orginally built by the same people who built them the first time.

Shoe repairs can take up to 90 days to be completed. You just need to send us your shoes and we will then contact you with an estimate of work and costs.

We do not accept shoes that have been repaired by anyone other than ourselves.

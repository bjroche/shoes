    <p class="gentxt">
      At La Bella Scarpa, the Laurent family has been making traditional shoes for as long as anyone can remember.

      We are a family business, started by our great-grandfather Pierre. Pierre had a passion for quality, stylish and contemporary footwear. He believed that if you created a great product then customers would come and stay with you. Over the last 100 years we have followed in his footsteps and our values are the same today!
